#Tonewheel Organ - GUI Setup & Test

###GUI for the Standalone Version, based on FLTK

You will need the light, cross-platform GUI library [FLTK](http://www.fltk.org/index.php) to use this code.
Compile it as static libraries. Put the Headers in *./FL*, and the output libraries in *./lib*.

It's not graphically advanced, but it works. The VST version will be based on a better library.

The test makefile is configured for **Linux** (my machine runs Ubuntu 14.04LTS 64bit)
