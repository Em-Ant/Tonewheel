#Tonewheel Organ GUI Test

#GUI for the standalone version, based on FLTK

You will need [FLTK](http://www.fltk.org/index.php)
Compile it as static libraries. Put the Headers in ./FL, and the output libraries in ./lib.
The makefile is configured for Linux AMD64 (my machine runs Ubuntu 14.04LTS, Kernel 3.13.0-xx)
